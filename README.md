The official Adobe site offers a 7-day Photoshop CS6 free download version for you to try. It lets you test the feature set of this software to determine whether it satisfies all your requirements. Despite being called a trial version, it comes with all the tools included in the paid edition.

**You can download the free trial version of Adobe Photoshop by doing the following:**

1. Visit the official Adobe site.

2. Press on Start Free Trial.

3. Choose a subscription plan – you will be automatically charged once the 7-day period ends. You can pick between 3 plans: monthly, annual with monthly billing, and annual with upfront billing.

Once you’ve chosen a subscription plan, click on Continue.

4. Type in your email address, which will be employed for handling all Adobe products. Now, click on Continue.

5. Adobe will ask you to specify your payment information, including your credit card or PayPal. However, the service won’t bill you until the free trial expires.

6. Once your chosen payment method is approved, you’ll have to type in or generate a password and then press on Complete Account.

7. The installation executable will be instantly downloaded to your system. Once the download process is finished, click on the file to start the installation.

8. Enter your account and proceed to install the software by pressing the Start Installer button.

9. After you download Adobe Creative Cloud, it will automatically install Photoshop onto your computer.
